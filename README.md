# VitaTrack

VitaTrack is an interactive wellness and safety dashboard that brings together real-time insights on hydration, air quality, UV exposure, weather, mental health, and disaster alerts into one unified platform. Built with React and a backend API, and enhanced with text-to-speech (TTS) for accessibility, VitaTrack empowers users to make informed decisions about their health and environment every day.

Users can enter their ZIP code to receive personalized metrics, including hydration tracking with progress visualization, UV index levels with color-coded risk categories, and local air quality with health-grade labels. The dashboard also provides weather updates and recent disaster alerts such as floods, wildfires, or power outages. To support emotional well-being, VitaTrack features a “Mental Health Message” component that delivers randomly selected inspirational quotes, encouraging positivity and resilience.

Key features include:

Hydration tracker with customizable goals and progress bars.

UV and air quality monitoring with clear health indicators.

Motivational mental health prompts to support daily wellness.

Localized weather updates and disaster awareness notifications.

Built-in chatbot for questions and guidance.

Text-to-speech for real-time spoken updates and improved accessibility.

Simplified UI mode for easier navigation.

VitaTrack was inspired by the need for a holistic health assistant that connects physical, mental, and environmental well-being in one place. Development involved integrating multiple APIs, building reusable UI components, and implementing accessibility-first features. Challenges included ensuring data accuracy across sources and designing an interface that remained intuitive despite the platform’s complexity.

Looking ahead, VitaTrack aims to expand with mobile deployment, wearable device integration, and predictive analytics to offer proactive health recommendations and early warnings for environmental risks.
